# WeatherApp
Simple project, a command line Python app that uses a simple weather API.

I've always wanted to make a nice command line weather app, and I'm currently trying to make one using Rich (https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 
along with the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org).
